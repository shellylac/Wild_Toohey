These patterns are also shaped by human behaviours, such as the times of day or week when people typically visit the forest or submit their wildlife sightings, and areas of the forest that are more or less visited."),

For example, spikes of recorded sightings for many species during 2021 likely stem from COVID lockdowns in that year facilitating increased local visits to Toohey Forest. Keeping these factors in mind will help you more accurately interpret the wildlife trends and hotspots displayed by Wild Toohey.")
