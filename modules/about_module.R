As a Tarragindi local, I grew up with the forest right in my backyard. I've spent countless hours walking, running, cycling, birdwatching, spotlighting, geocaching, and picnicking here. I adore its striking beauty and feel especially privileged by the wildlife encounters I've hadâ€”although I know firsthand how surprisingly challenging it can be to spot these amazing creatures!

Wild Toohey was inspired by my desire to make wildlife spotting easier and more rewarding, not just for myself but for everyone who loves Toohey Forest.

With Wild Toohey, you have instant access to everything you need for memorable wildlife experiences: interactive maps of recent and historic sightings, detailed charts showing annual, monthly, and daily wildlife trends, valuable insights into seasonal wildlife hotspots, and a comprehensive species list complete with images and helpful information.

So, what are you waiting for? Grab your binos, your boots, and your water bottle, and let Wild Toohey guide you to your next unforgettable wildlife adventure!"),

The ALA aggregates data from multiple databases, including iNaturalist, eBird, BirdLife Australia, FrogID, Koala Count, WildNet, and many others.

Wild Toohey accesses ALA databases to extract records of species occurrence within the broad bounds of Toohey Forest over the past 10 years. The data were filtered using the [ALA data profile](https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000240256-getting-started-with-the-data-profiles) which applies a standard set of data quality filters. The data behind Wild Toohey updates daily every Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday."),

        h3("Interpreting trends and hotspots"),
        p("The data for Wild Toohey come from community-submitted records of species sightings. It is important to recognise that the patterns seen in the annual, monthly and daily trend figures and in the hotspot maps do not solely reflect wildlife locations and movements. These patterns are also shaped by human behaviours, such as the times of day or week when people typically visit the forest or submit their wildlife sightings, and areas of the forest that are more or less visited. Additionally, external factors and events, can significantly impact trends by altering the frequency and timing of forest visits and sightings. For example, spikes of recorded sightings for many species during 2021 likely stem from COVID lockdowns in that year facilitating increased local visits to Toohey Forest. Keeping these factors in mind will help you more accurately interpret the wildlife trends and hotspots displayed by Wild Toohey."),
